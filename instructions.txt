In this project, you will create one or more customized graphics using <div>, <svg>, or <canvas> elements.

Sometimes, we want to design a specific type of graphic for the web, perhaps one that cannot be generated using standard
tools such as Google Sheets, Flourish, or RawGRAPHs. In such cases, gaining a solid understanding of the fundamental
mechanisms for creating images on the web can be highly advantageous.

This project is an opportunity for you to experiment with creating graphics. You can choose to create bar charts, maps,
lines, pictograms, or any other format you desire. The choice of graphic and technology is entirely up to you.

As starting points, here are 3 suggestions for you:

Start with a question (e.g., Which pop singers have the longest songs? or How rent prices have increased in Miami in thepast decade?);
Start with a dataset (e.g., OBIS.org or a new report you want to analyze);
Start with a visual inspiration (e.g., You found an interesting chart you want to mimic)

The main evaluation criteria for this project are as follows:

Creativity: Does your graphic exhibit original or innovative elements in terms of concept, interaction, animation, etc.?
Technical Proficiency: Does your website function seamlessly without errors on at least one type of device?
Aesthetics: Does your project demonstrate refined visual styles and presentation?

Your submission should include the following:

A public link to the project (on platforms like GitHub Pages or others)
A paragraph that describes your experience during the creation process, including any challenges faced and lessons learned
Any supplementary materials (e.g., drafts, prototypes) that help convey your idea or design process
